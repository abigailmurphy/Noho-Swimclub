# Noho-Swimclub
A webapp and tool for the Northampton Swim Club

## Uses
This tool was inspired by my previous summer job as a lifeguard at an outdoor pool. At first I wanted to just practice my skills from Webapp Development and make an aesthetic WebApp that allows users to log in and out, and if the user is "admin" then post updates to the site. Since, I decided to begin to expand this project to make paperwork easier. Currently to apply for a membership you have to mail in an application and then recieve an email about if you get it. Additionally, guest sign-ups are on a third-party app. In the works is managing memberships, the user may create an account by applying for a membership. Once they apply they are placed on the waitlist where admin can decide to offer or deny their membership. They can look for updates in their portal on their membership, and if they recieve an offer they can accept or deny. There is a third user view that is current member user. After I have further polished what I currently have, my goal is to move onto adding a signup page for current members to sign up to bring non-member guests to the pool. 

## Tools
This project was built using node.js and express with MongoDB as the database of choice.
